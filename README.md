## LOF - Left over food
Time to save those who are helpess when it comes to basic need like food.
LOF is a platform for donors and receivers to post their request and get it full filled within 24-hrs
LOF also provides a socially interactive POV and fun score "goodwillpoints" to motivate everyone for healthy donations and authenticate response.

# Features of LOF

## Simple and free of cost
### Step 1
Register on our app
### step 2 
#### choose your role (Donor, Receiver, Normal User)
Post Donation/Request or Read Blogs 

### step 3
Help each other and maintain Goodwill Points to stay on top .

## How it Works!
Donors will get 1 Goodwill point and Receiver 100 points
on one each successful donation donor will receive 10 points which will help them stay on top blogs which will help them grow their public value
and Receivers will loose 10 points every 24hrs post successful donation if they dont give credits to donors by writing few words of gratitude about the donors.
This will help both to stay motivated and not take advantage of the other.
